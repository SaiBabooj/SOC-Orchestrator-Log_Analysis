# 🛡️ AI-Driven SOC Orchestration Platform

An enterprise-grade Security Operations Center (SOC) orchestration platform built to automate Level 1 triage, accelerate Level 2 deep investigations, and autonomously generate Level 3 executive closure reports using Elastic Security and Google Gemini AI.

This platform bridges the gap between raw Elasticsearch security telemetry and actionable, AI-enriched incident lifecycles dynamically rendered inside a modern React application.

## ✨ Core Features

The platform operates on a three-tier AI incident lifecycle:

### 🟢 L1: AI Triage & MITRE Enrichment
- Automatically ingests raw security logs triggered by high-risk thresholds (>70).
- Applies **Deduplication** algorithms (preventing repeated alerts within 10-minute windows).
- Instantly maps threat patterns to the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** (Tactic, Technique, Confidence Level).
- Generates an initial AI Triage summary highlighting immediate impact and remediation steps.
- Escalate incidents to `CRITICAL` natively if repeat-offender thresholds are met.

### 🟣 L2: Deep AI Investigation
- Triggered manually by an Analyst shifting a Threat to `INVESTIGATING`.
- Performs **Deep Analysis** encompassing the original log telemetry, the L1 Triage context, and analyst notes.
- Automatically generates:
  - 🕸️ **Attack Path Analysis**: How the threat is transversing the environment.
  - 🛡️ **Containment Strategy**: Precise, immediate steps to sandbox the threat.
  - ⚠️ **Risk If Ignored**: Executive blast-radius assessment.

### 🟢 L3: Executive Closure Protocol
- Activated upon resolving an incident (`RESOLVED`).
- AI consolidates the entire audit lifecycle safely via atomic Elasticsearch patches into a final `Closure Report`.
- Dynamically outputs:
  - **Executive Summary**
  - **Response Actions Taken**
  - **Residual Risk Analysis**
  - **Lessons Learned**

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Database / SIEM Engine**: Elasticsearch (Stores raw `security-logs` and enriched `incidents`).
- **AI Inference Pipeline**: Elastic's Inference API (`.google-gemini-2.5-flash-completion`).
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) orchestrating incident states using strict Elasticsearch atomic updates.
- **Frontend**: React + Vite, decorated with TailwindCSS & Lucide icons.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js (v18+)
- An active Elasticsearch Cloud instance with Inference Capabilities enabled.

### 1. Environment Setup

Inside the root directory (`incident_ai/`), create a `.env` file containing your Elastic credentials:
```env
ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID=your-cloud-id
ELASTIC_USERNAME=your-username
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=your-password
```

*(Note: The frontend `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is natively tracked via `frontend/.env` and points to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)*

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI Server
cd backend
PYTHONPATH=.. uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Start the Frontend

In a separate terminal:
```bash
cd frontend

# Install Node modules
npm install

# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:5173`.

##  Emulating SOC Operations

1. **Trigger the Orchestrator:** Click the **"Manual Detection Orchestrator"** navigation tab and press **Run SOAR Engine Now**. This will simulate an Elastic Watcher ingesting the latest malicious log payload and escalating it.
2. **Review Triage:** On the Dashboard, click the newly generated incident to review the **L1 AI Triage** & **MITRE Matrix**.
3. **Deep Investigation:** Enter initial "Analyst Notes" and click **Start Deep Investigation**. Wait for the engine to yield the purple L2 Deep Analysis module.
4. **Resolution Finalization:** Log any final steps in the notes and click **Mark as Resolved** to immediately generate the final emerald Executive Closure Report.

## 🔐 Security Constraints Adopted
- No destructive operations (`es.index`) exist within the API layer. Updates utilize atomic `es.update` patches to preserve audit trails.
- All AI inferences fail gracefully and write back localized error schemas.
- Escalation policies rely strictly on static threshold bounds verified directly by Elasticsearch aggregations.

> **Note on Deployment & Local Usage:**
> The live deployed version of this web application may not run to completion as the backend utilizes a paid tier of Elastic Cloud for its AI Inference capabilities. To experience the full functionality of this project, you will need to run it locally or deploy it yourself using your own paid Elastic Cloud credentials...
